# Linear Regression
* Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful and mostly used algorithm in data science.
* There are a plethora of real-world applications of Linear Regression.
* This comprehensive guide will introduce you to Linear Regression along with an implementation in Python on a real-world dataset.

Linear regression is a type of statistical analysis used to predict the relationship between two variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, and aims to find the best-fitting line that describes the relationship. The line is determined by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values.

Linear regression is commonly used in many fields, including economics, finance, and social sciences, to analyze and predict trends in data. It can also be extended to multiple linear regression, where there are multiple independent variables, and logistic regression, which is used for binary classification problems.

# Linear Regression With Single Variable

Linear Regression with one variable is also called as “univariate linear regression”. This is just more fancy way to call it.

Linear regression with one variable is used when you want to predict a single output value from a single input value. That means you only have one x as input(attribute) and one y as output.
